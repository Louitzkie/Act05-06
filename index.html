    <h2>How should we deal with PTSD?</h2>
    <!-- ordered list items in roman numerals  -->
    <ol class="ordered-list" type="i">
      <li>
        Follow your treatment plan. Although it may take a while to feel
        benefits from therapy or medications, treatment can be effective, and
        most people do recover. Remind yourself that it takes time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn about PTSD. This knowledge can help you understand what you're
        feeling, and then you can develop coping strategies to help you respond
        effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take care of yourself. Get enough rest, eat a healthy diet, exercise and
        take time to relax. Try to reduce or avoid caffeine and nicotine, which
        can worsen anxiety.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't self-medicate. Turning to alcohol or drugs to numb your feelings
        isn't healthy, even though it may be a tempting way to cope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break the cycle. When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or jump into a
        hobby to re-focus. Stay connected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spend time with supportive and caring people â€” family, friends, faith
        leaders or others. You don't have to talk about what happened if you
        don't want to. Just sharing time with loved ones can offer healing and
        comfort.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider a support group. Ask your mental health professional for help
        finding a support group, or contact veterans' organizations or your
        community's social services system. Or look for local support groups in
        an online directory.
